## What is Codeigniter 4 HMVC?

**HMVC** (Hierarchical Model-View-Controller) is an extension of the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. In the context of CodeIgniter 4, HMVC allows you to organize your application into modules, each containing its own set of Models, Views, and Controllers. This modular approach helps in organizing large applications by dividing them into smaller, more manageable sections.
